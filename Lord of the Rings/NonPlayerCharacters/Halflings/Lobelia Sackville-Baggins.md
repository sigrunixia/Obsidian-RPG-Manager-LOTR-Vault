### Non Player Character Story

- Lobelia is a distant relative of Bilbo Baggins, and believes as the closest full-blooded Baggin's that Bag End should be hers. When given any oppurtunity, she is not above to stealing from the property, and has become adept at dodging the launched potatoes of [**Samwise Gamgee**](../../Characters/Samwise%20Gamgee.md)
