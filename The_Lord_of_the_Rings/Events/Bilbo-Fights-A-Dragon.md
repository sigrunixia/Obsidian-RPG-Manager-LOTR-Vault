## Event Details


## Game Master Details

- The fireworks lit by [Merry](../Characters/Meriadoc-Brandybuck.md) and [Pippin](../Characters/Peregrin-Took.md) are a special type of Firework. A more.. sentient type of magic, but very temperamental. It is comedic magic that Gandalf was working on that currently only knows how to trade insults, and then explode in starbursts when it loses.
