  synopsis: "The Baggins family have lived all around the Shire since their formation, though they have concentrated around Hobbiton. They are perceived by their community as well-to-do and a respectable sort. Most importantly, a Baggins was predictable. This gave them connections into other aristocratic families in the form of the Brandybucks and Tooks, which allowed marriages of convenience to form the Sackville-Bagginses and the Chub-Bagginses."
