# The Black Riders

  synopsis: "Legends once told of the fabled shadow-warriors of Sauron, but they long faded into obscurity and myth. Terrifying power, with breath that stole warmth and life from all nearby. They were a force to be reckoned with, and Middle Earth should be so glad that they fell after the defeat of the Dark One."
