# Obsidian RPG-Manager Lord of the Rings Sample Vault

This is a filled Lord of the Ring's Vault to allow you to see how [**Obsidian RPG Manager**](https://github.com/carlonicora/obsidian-rpg-manager) can work with with your campaign. It is ready to explore, or to begin playing with a group of 2-4 players as one of the halflings. 

If you are new to using the plugin, it is recommended you read the Beginner's Guide first. 

## Suggested TTRPG Systems

As this is a sample vault and meant to show off a variety of features, it is not as structured or customized as your dedicated campaign vault would be. As such, we suggest if you create or utilize the pre-made characters, that you use a more rules-lite system. 

Some suggestions are:

- [**Caumaldë: The Girl Scouts of Middle Earth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/sh1dyi/updated_expanded_by_popular_request_caumaldë_the/)
- RAW

Alternatively, if you wanted to try an wargames style campaign between factions, we suggest using [**Muster**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/413382/Muster?filters=0_0_100_0_0). We also found that the more rule-heavy [**Ironsworn**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/238369/Ironsworn?manufacturers_id=12876) worked well in testing. 

### Legal Disclaimer

The sample vault to practice in utilizing RPG Manager uses the worldbuilding and story of The Lord of the Rings, created by John Ronald Reuel Tolkien who is more commonly known as J.R.R. Tolkien, and Christopher Tolkien. This story was chosen not only due it having such an impact on the creation of table-top roleplaying games, but due to it being so recognizable thanks to Peter Jackson's adaptation, that its use as an educational tool would be effective to our multicultural plugin use base. Furthermore, RPG Manager, and its contributers do not collect any funds towards the management of this plugin, guides, nor vault. As such, we are claiming a fair use of this material under [**17 U.S. Code § 107**](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107).

All rights to the story, the characters, the world, elements, and any other attributing figures created by the Tolkiens, remain with the Tolkiens and their Estate as well as Harper Collins Publishing. Media and merchandizing rights for the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit were recently purchased by Embracer Group, however it is under contention with Warner Brothers and the Saul Zaentz Co., which is a long winded way of saying that **none of us on this Github own those rights or intend to take those rights**.
